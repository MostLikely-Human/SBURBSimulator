2018-05-23: Hopefully this works.
2018-05-25: I think I'll try to add HB as a wrangler. (I don't think I'll make humanBotJr, but you never know.)
2018-05-26: I'm now a Waste.
2018-06-06: I should probably use this more often. <span class='void'>People don't usually like looking through code.</span>
2018-06-25: I fixed session 13, I have no idea what I did but it's fixed, for some reason HB's quirk was breaking it, which means there are some bugs in HB's coding.
2018-06-26: IT'S WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.
2018-06-27: I have so much to work on, there's coding for the Law aspect, fixing HB, doing stuff on my WiS server<span class='void'>, maybe making humanBotJr, updating easter eggs</span>, I keep forgetting to work on Law.
2018-07-06: I changed 225 to 247, leaving for a trip tommorow though.
2018-07-16: I forgot to change ONE thing, and session 247 broke. <span class='void'>I'm thinking about changing my classpect to something stupid like MostLikely of Human soon.</span>
2018-09-09: This is on a website now! WOOP WOOP WOOP!
2018-09-22: Juice update's finally been released. Yeet
2018-10-24: If you have any questions about this mod, DM Proxxima on Discord
2019-02-20: So now that JR added a link here onto the SburbSim main page, I thought I'd change my newsposts to be *actually readable*, I may clean up a few other things on this site.
