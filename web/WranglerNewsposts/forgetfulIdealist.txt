2018-05-25: I think I'll try to add HB as a wrangler. (I don't think I'll make humanBotJr, but you never know.)
2018-05-26: I'm now a Waste.

2018-06-26: IT'S WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.
2018-06-27: I have so much to work on, there's coding for the Law aspect, fixing HB, doing stuff on my WiS server<span class='void'>, maybe making humanBotJr, updating easter eggs</span>, I keep forgetting to work on Law.
